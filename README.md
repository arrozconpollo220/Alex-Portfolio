  ## Description
  This application is my professional portfolio page. On this site I will be showcasing my working and telling about myself and how to contact me.

  ## Installation
  The following technologies were used to create this application: Node.js, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, GitHub, Vite, Railway, CSS, HTML

  ## Usage
  This is my professional portfolio page which will mainly be to showcase my previous work with software engineering. When you load the site, you will be greeted with the Home page and at the top you will see there is a navbar with navigation buttons (home, about, portfolio, experience, contact & Resume) that you can switch to at anytime. At the bottom of the page, there are social media icons for LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, X & Gmail. On the About page there is a short paragraph which is about me and who I am and an emoji pic of me. On the Portfolio page I have 3 sites that I have worked on. The first one is SLC Events, which was my first project and the second and third sites were two weekly challenges that I worked on, which was a Weather Dashboard and a Note Taker site. On the Experience page, I have one project that I worked on for a client, which was the Dead Faces clothing brand site. On the Contact page, there is a form where people can submit their name, email and a message to me. Lastly, on the Resume page, there is an image of my downloadable resume.
